      <h1>Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare</h1>
      <p>
        Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the healthcare landscape, from revolutionizing patient care to streamlining hospital operations. As AI technologies continue to evolve, they are enabling healthcare providers to deliver better, faster, and more personalized care while also improving the efficiency of healthcare systems globally.

      <h2>The Power of AI in Diagnosis and Treatment</h2>
      <p>
        One of the most significant ways AI is impacting healthcare is through its ability to assist in diagnosis and treatment planning. With AI-powered tools, medical professionals can now analyze complex data sets, such as imaging studies, lab results, and even genomic information, with unprecedented accuracy. AI algorithms can detect patterns and abnormalities in medical images—such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans—that may be difficult for the human eye to catch. This helps clinicians make more accurate diagnoses and develop more effective treatment plans.
